# ZanLing-TrueZero
A python chess engine that starts from Zero.

## About the Engine
The name of the Engine is taken from 真零, which is Chinese for "True Zero" and romanised using [Jyutping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyutping) for Cantonese. 

Instead of being hard-coded by humans, the Engine learns how to play through playing games from itself and learning from randomly generated games.
